## Cloud Models

### 3 Levels of cloud computing

- Infrastructure-as-a-service

  This is usually when you have access to VMs and complete control over them, load balancers / virtual machines / gateways.

- Platform-as-a-service

  Uploading code that a cloud provider will run for you, no access to the underlying operating system/hardware

- Software-as-a-service
  
  Typically you run these services in your browser, such as Office365/Dropbox/Googledocs
  
  
### Shared Responsibity Model

The shared responsibility model will be demonstrate whether the cloud provider or the customer will have ownership/responsibility.

Software-as-a-service for example, the customer will be responsibile for the data and accounts, however the physical datacenter security will be down to the cloud provider. 

### Serverless Model

With the serviceless model you don't have to select a plan such as Premium/Basic, this is since the Cloudprovider will autoscale for you. Platform-as-a-service however will require the user to select which level of compute they require, and scaling will be down to the user. 

Serverless model could also result in completely free bills, this is since you're only paying for the compute used, therefore if no one was to browse your web app hosted via serverless, then the usage would be zero.

## Global Infrastructure

AZ = Availability Zone

* Fault Domains = Different physical hardware to prevent outage due to a single server being down
* Update Domains = Different groups so they arent all effected by updates at once
