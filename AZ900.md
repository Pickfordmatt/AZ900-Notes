## Cloud Models

### 3 Levels of cloud computing

- Infrastructure-as-a-service

  This is usually when you have access to VMs and complete control over them, load balancers / virtual machines / gateways.

- Platform-as-a-service

  Uploading code that a cloud provider will run for you, no access to the underlying operating system/hardware

- Software-as-a-service
  
  Typically you run these services in your browser, such as Office365/Dropbox/Googledocs

## Global Infrastructure

AZ = Availability Zone

* Fault Domains = Different physical hardware to prevent outage due to a single server being down
* Update Domains = Different groups so they arent all effected by updates at once
